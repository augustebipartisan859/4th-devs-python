### Description:
MCP Native Demo — one agent using both MCP tools and native Python tools.
Shows how MCP tools (from a server) and plain function tools can be unified
behind a single handler map and driven by the same agent loop.
The model doesn't know which tools are MCP and which are native.

Run:
    python app.py
